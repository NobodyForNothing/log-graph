# log graph

Log graph is a simple tool to create minimalistic graphs from log files in toml like format:
```
[Mon Apr  1 00:13:32 2024]
Iteration 14190000 / 334007599
Iteration 23160000 / 129088151
[Mon Apr  1 00:20:09 2024]
Iteration 23170000 / 129088151
Iteration 14200000 / 334007599
```
While not being scientifically accurate or even labeled for that matter, these graphs allow understanding simple trends in data at a glance.

This is a minor side project targeting simplicity and getting _finished_. This will likely not accept most patches and will have only limited maintenance.
